A bit of fiddling around with [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull).

## Get Started

1. Run `docker-compose up` and wait for the environment to be up and running
2. Open `docker-compose logs` and keep and eye on the logs
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/countdown?count=[number]` and watch how a new job is added to the queue and processed
